# Motivation and purpose

**Our Role:** Data scientists at a consultancy firm.

**Target Audience:** General public.

The public's understanding of the distribution and prevalence of crime in Canada is often not based on the robust data collected by police departments around the country.  Instead, people's knowledge of crime is often derived from stories circulating through communities and stories presented in the media.  Both these sources of information have significant limitations.  For example, a given person will only hear about a small percentage of total crimes committed across the nation through the media or through community connections.  Additionally, crimes that are violent or otherwise sensational are often overrepresented.  

In order to foster an understanding of crime that is more comprehensive and less biased, our team will create a dashboard which allows the public to easily view and explore Canadian crime data.  These data will be derived from Statistics Canada.  The dashboard should be easy to navigate for someone from the general population and provide summary information in a way that is easy to interpret.  The dashboard should be interactive and allow users to explore types, locations, and frequency of crimes committed as well as the time period in which they occurred.
