DSCI 532 - Group 22

The project housed in this repository has been created in partial fulfillment of the requirements of DSCI 532 of the University of British Columbia's Master of Data Science program (2020/2021).  The purpose of this project is to create an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore and interact with a data set.  The [proposal document](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/532_Group_22/proposal.md) provides information on the hypothetical scenario for which this dashboard is being created.
