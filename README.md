# DSCI 532 - Group 22

The project housed in this repository has been created in partial fulfillment of the requirements of DSCI 532: Visualization II of the University of British Columbia's Master of Data Science program (2020/2021).  The purpose of this project is to create an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore and interact with a data set.  Please click the following link to view our proposal for [*Criminality in Canada: Fighting Anecdotes with Data*](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/532_Group_22/blob/main/proposal.md). 

The data source is [Incident-based crime statistics, by detailed violations, Canada, provinces, territories and Census Metropolitan Areas](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/cv.action?pid=3510017701) released by Statistics Canada. 

#### App Design
A pdf copy of the sketch of our proposed app can be found [here](https://github.com/sbabicki/532_Group_22/blob/main/design_mockup.pdf).  

The app contains two tabs which can be selected which have different customization options. Widgets with writing in <span style="color:red">red</span> are additional features that we would like to have, but we do not deem them essential to implement if we do not have the time or resources to complete them. 

The first tab, **Geographic Crime Comparisons**, explores differences in crime between different provinces and between different census metropolitan areas (CMA). 
![Tab 1](design_mockup_tab_1.png "Tab 1 - Geographic Crime Comparisons")

A choropleth map shows the colour coded difference in the crime rate metric for provinces and a bar chart shows the difference for CMAs. The user can select one of 4 violation types from a dropdown menu (e.g. "Total drug violations"). The user can also select which year to filter by using a slider. 

Additional optional features are Select Metric and Select Subcategory. Select Metric allows the user to select a different metric to display instead of the default "Rate per 100,000" (e.g. "Actual incidents"). Select Subcategory allows the user to specify a violation subcategory rather than its parent category (e.g. "Possession, Cocaine" instead of "Total drug violations").

The second tab, **Crime Time Trends**, explores trends in crime over time for selected areas.
![Tab 2](design_mockup_tab_2.png "Tab 2 - Crime Time Trends")

Four time-series plots show the trends over time for crime rate in selected locations. The user can select to compare either CMAs or Provinces. Then, they can select multiple locations of that type from a widget which allows multiple items to be selected. A line with a different colour for each select location will appear on each plot.

An additional optional feature is Select Metric, which allows the user to select a different metric to display instead of the default "Rate per 100,000" (e.g. "Actual incidents").
